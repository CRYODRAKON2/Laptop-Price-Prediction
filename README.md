# Laptop Price Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on various features like brand, processor type, RAM size, storage, etc. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use and accurate prediction tool for consumers or businesses looking to estimate the market value of laptops.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following key files and folders:

```
├── data/
│   └── laptops.csv          # Raw dataset used for model training and testing
├── notebooks/
│   └── Laptop Price Prediction.ipynb    # Jupyter notebook for data analysis, feature engineering, and model training
├── models/
│   └── trained_model.pkl    # Saved model for future predictions
├── README.md                # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
```

- **data/**: Contains the raw dataset of laptops used for training the model.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebook where data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building are performed.
- **models/**: Directory for storing trained models.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages and libraries to run the project.

## Data Description

The dataset contains information about laptops, with features such as:

- **Brand**: The laptop's manufacturer (e.g., Dell, HP, Lenovo).
- **Processor**: The type of processor (e.g., Intel i5, Ryzen 5).
- **RAM**: The size of RAM in GB.
- **Storage**: The storage capacity, including SSD and HDD sizes.
- **Screen Size**: The size of the display.
- **Price**: The target variable, representing the price of the laptop.

The data undergoes cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation to be suitable for model training.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-prediction.git
   cd laptop-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook to train the model or make predictions:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Laptop Price Prediction.ipynb
   ```

4. If you want to use the pre-trained model, load the `trained_model.pkl` from the `models/` directory for predictions.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of `XX%` (replace this with your actual model performance) on the test dataset. The features most contributing to the model's predictions include brand, processor type, RAM size, and storage capacity.
